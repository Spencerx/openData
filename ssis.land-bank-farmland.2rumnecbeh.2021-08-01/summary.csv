conversation-description,"This is a community discussion on issues related to the Land Bank and how they could adapt to best address the community's interests. Your voice is needed to help them fulfill their stated mission and serve our community. Please join the effort below to inform what the community wants for this area, now and for future generations. The current mandate of the Land Bank is to ""preserve in perpetuity areas in the county that have environmental, agricultural, aesthetic, cultural, scientific, historic, scenic or low-intensity recreational value and to protect existing and future sources of potable water.""

This discussion will run through July, and outcomes will be communicated back to the Land Bank and community, providing insight into view distributions and with the potential of informing Land Bank policy going forward.

My name is Kaj Litch, and I am running this as part of an internship through Spring Street International School. 

You may vote on as many questions as you like, any contribution is meaningful. If you return to the discussion new statements will be available for your input.
