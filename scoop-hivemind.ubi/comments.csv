1. Replace the jobseekers benefit with an income neutral UBI; 2. index this UBI by inflation, growth, and increases in productivity; 3. introduce a kids' basic income; 4. expand on the Government's voluntary relocation scheme to make replacing the accommodation supplement more feasible in the future."

1503400655360,Tue Aug 22 04:17:35 PDT 2017,61,0,43,6,1,UBI is important to a fully functioning democracy. Voters cannot give due attention to politics when they have to worry about where the next meal is coming from or whether they will be able to pay their electricity bill.

1502744190929,Mon Aug 14 13:56:30 PDT 2017,47,55,1,0,0,A UBI might be a citizens' dividend distributed from 'rent' (not 'tax') paid by owners of private property for their use of social capital.

1502661265267,Sun Aug 13 14:54:25 PDT 2017,43,2,1,0,0,I have advocated for some time that the minimum wage needs to be increased substantially. I now realise a UBI is a much better way.

1502652878397,Sun Aug 13 12:34:38 PDT 2017,29,0,45,43,1,Focusing resources on UBI rather than on pooled risk-sharing mechanisms will encourage people to provide for themselves with their income rather than promoting social solidarity.
